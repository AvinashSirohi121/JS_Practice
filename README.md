## Introduction

In the fast-paced world of front-end development, staying updated with the latest trends and knowledge is crucial. This repository includes a curated list of interview questions ranging from basic to advanced levels, covering various aspects of JavaScript and front-end development.

## Questions and Answers

We have organized the questions into several categories:

1. **Basic JavaScript**
2. **ES6 and Beyond**
3. **DOM Manipulation**
4. **Event Handling**
5. **Asynchronous JavaScript**
6. **Web APIs**
7. **Performance Optimization**
8. **Frameworks and Libraries** (React, Angular, Vue, etc.)
9. **Tooling** (Webpack, Babel, etc.)

Each section includes questions with detailed answers and explanations. Here are some sample questions to get you started:

### Basic JavaScript

1. **What is a closure in JavaScript?**
   - A closure is a function that remembers its outer variables and can access them. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

2. **Explain the difference between `==` and `===`.**
   - `==` checks for equality with type conversion, while `===` checks for equality without type conversion (strict equality).

### Asynchronous JavaScript

1. **What is the event loop?**
   - The event loop is a process that continuously checks the call stack to see if there's any function that needs to run. If the call stack is empty, it looks at the callback queue to see if there are any pending callbacks to execute.

2. **What are Promises and how do they work?**
   - Promises are objects that represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. They allow you to chain asynchronous operations, making your code more readable and maintainable.
